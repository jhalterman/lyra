override which AMQP response codes are retryable/recoverable
build queue/exchange recovery where an individual channel (or all channels) can be directed to recover queues/exchanges that are declared through the channel
a channel recovery failure that results in a connection recovery should wait on the connection recovery
ability to await recovery of a resource. perhaps can be addressed with listeners.
consider throwing RecoveryInProgressException or something like that if an invocation fails while recovery is in progress. this is perhaps a better alternative to AlreadyClosedException which implies that things are hosed for good.
