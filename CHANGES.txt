0.3.2

This release includes a few API changes:

- RecoveryPolicy was broken out into a separate class.
- ConnectionListener.onChannelRecovery was added.
- ChannelListener.onConsumerRecovery was added.

This release also includes a few behavioral changes:

- When a channel is closed and recovered, attempts to ack/nack/reject messages that were delivered before the channel was recovered are simply ignored since their delivery tags will be invalid for the newly recovered channel. Instead these messages will be re-delivered with new delivery tags.
- ConnectionListener.onRecovery is now called after the connection is recovered, but before the channels are recovered. ConnectionListener.onChannelRecovery is called after the connection and channels are recovered.
- ChannelListener.onRecovery is now called after the channel is recovered, but before the consumers are recovered. ChannelListener.onConsumerRecovery is called after the channel and consumers are recovered.
